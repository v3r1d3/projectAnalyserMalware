# projectAnalyserMalware

The algorithm of operation:

Iterate through the project and process each one .py of the file
Code parsing
Collecting all suspicious imports/calls, base64 imports/calls, internet imports/calls
Output according to the config



Python:

settings = {
'BLACKLISTED_IMPORTS': ('os', 'subprocess', 'pickle', 'cPickle', 'marshal'), # Trigger-imports
'BLACKLISTED_FUNCTIONS': ('eval', 'exec', 'system', 'execfile'), # Trigger-functions
'BASE64': False, # Does the project need to have BASE64 encoding? (is often used to encode stolen data)
'INTERNET_ACCESS': False, # Does the project need to have access to the Internet?
}

BLACKLISTED_BASE64_PACKAGES = ('base64',) # which packages are considered base64
BLACKLISTED_INTERNET_PACKAGES = (
'requests', 'httpx', 'urllib', 'aiohttp', 'http.client', 'socket', 'sockets',
'websocket', 'websockets', 'treq', 'httpie') # which packages are considered internet


Config values:

settings.BLACKLISTED_IMPORTS - packages that will be considered suspicious for import (dangerous packages are enabled by default, with which you can harm the system)
settings.BLACKLISTED_FUNCTIONS - functions, the import of which will be considered suspicious (by default, dangerous packages are included, with which you can harm the system)
settings.BASE64 - whether BASE64 should be present in the code (for example, a side checker, BASE64 should hardly be there, so the value is False); packages for verification are taken from BLACKLISTED_BASE64_PACKAGES
settings.INTERNET_ACCESS - should the project use the Internet (); packages for verification are taken from BLACKLISTED_INTERNET_PACKAGES, optionally you can add selenium and other potentially dangerous libraries there
